# Project Name: SimCLR Frame-work for defect detection on unknown context

This is the SimCLR Frame work developed on the contrastive learning approach for image classification and objetec detection. This work is built on the ideas from Ting Chen et. al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029 and the basic code was developed using ideas from Andras Beres: https://keras.io/examples/vision/semisupervised_simclr/
